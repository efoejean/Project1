- My overall experience while creating this App was good. I was immersed in basic skill of creating and testing the app and fix issues. It was very impressive how sometime when we change a code, it affects the whole codeü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇ‚Äç, and we must rewrite or find another way to make everything look good.
- I have learned how to display Array elements into a table using template. I have also improved on how to write clean code, even though it is not perfect yetüòâ, I have managed to create import function and data from another file.

### Built With

<!-- TODO: List any MAJOR libraries/frameworks (e.g. React, Tailwind) with links to their homepages. -->

- I have built this App with basic [Vanilla JavaScript] (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) .

## Features

<!-- TODO: List what specific 'user problems' that this application solves. -->

- The purpose of this app is to track clients and services. We can add new customers to the table by filling and submitting the form .
- We can sort the table by date to have the upcoming appointment in order. We can filter the table by date. We can also look up a client by name or phone number. We can also search by services and stylists to keep track of the service provide and which stylist provide it.
- We can also reward the client per month by setting the filter on the rewards form and pick a winner.
  In the future we would like to have table for completed and cancel appointments.
